# Home Assistant Add-on: NgIRCd

A lightweight IRC server.

## About

[ngIRCd](https://github.com/ngircd/ngircd) is a free, portable and lightweight Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server for small or private networks.

The name ngIRCd means next-generation IRC daemon, which is a little bit exaggerated: lightweight Internet Relay Chat server most probably would have been a better name :-)
